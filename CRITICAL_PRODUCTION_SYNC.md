# CRITICAL PRODUCTION SYNC ISSUE - June 30, 2025

## Problem Identified
- Replit: 7,186 test records fully functional with upload/manual entry
- samselt.com (Render): 0 test records showing, database empty
- Production deployment not synchronizing test score data

## Root Cause Analysis
1. Test scores database seeding may not be running on Render deployment
2. Foreign key constraints preventing test score insertion
3. Database initialization sequence issues on fresh Render deployments

## Immediate Actions Required
1. Force reseed production database with all 7,186 test records
2. Verify database schema compatibility on Render
3. Ensure test score seeding runs after school seeding
4. Add production verification endpoint to check data status

## Files Modified
- server/comprehensiveTestSeed.ts - Enhanced production seeding
- server/test-scores-api.ts - Added production verification
- server/initDb.ts - Improved initialization sequence

## Expected Outcome
- samselt.com shows all 7,186 test records
- Database overview shows correct counts (ALCPT: 1,710, Book: 2,056, ECL: 1,710, OPI: 1,710)
- Upload and manual entry functionality works on production
