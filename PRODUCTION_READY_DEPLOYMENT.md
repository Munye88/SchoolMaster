✅ client/src/pages/Reports.tsx - Enhanced three-tab reports with authentic data
✅ server/index.ts - Added production database verification system
✅ server/routes.ts - Fixed force-reseed endpoint for production debugging

✅ EMERGENCY_PRODUCTION_FIX.md - Complete deployment guide
```

### 2. Production Deployment Commands
```bash
# Stage all critical changes
git add .

# Commit with production-focused message
git commit -m "PRODUCTION FIX: Test tracker and reports with 7186 authentic records"

# Push to trigger Render deployment
git push origin main
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
After GitHub push and Render auto-deployment:

**Test API Endpoints:**
```bash
# Should return 7186 (currently returns 0)
curl https://samselt.com/api/test-scores | jq '. | length'

# Should return authentic dashboard data
curl https://samselt.com/api/reports/dashboard

# Force reseed if needed
curl -X POST https://samselt.com/api/test-scores/force-reseed
```

**Test Frontend Pages:**
- Visit samselt.com/test-tracker
- Verify 7,186 records display with month/cycle navigation
- Check samselt.com/reports for three functional tabs
- Confirm all data is authentic (not mock)

### 4. Expected Production Results
- Test tracker displays 7,186 authentic test records across all schools
- Reports section shows three tabs with real analytics and charts
- Month/cycle navigation works for historical test data browsing
- All 73 instructor profiles and authentic student data maintained

### 5. Emergency Fallback
If automatic seeding fails on production:
1. Access Render dashboard
2. Manually restart the service
3. Monitor startup logs for database seeding
4. Use force-reseed endpoint if necessary

## Files Ready for Immediate Deployment
All changes tested locally and confirmed working with authentic data. Production deployment will resolve the missing test records issue on samselt.com.
