# RENDER PRODUCTION FIX - Complete Test Records Access Solution

## Root Cause Analysis
The samselt.com production database has:
- Schools exist with IDs 1, 2, 3 (KFNA, NFS East, NFS West)
- Test scores attempting to reference school IDs 349, 350, 351
- Foreign key constraint violations preventing test record uploads

## Immediate Solution Implemented

### Production-Compatible Test Seeding
Updated `server/comprehensiveTestSeed.ts` to:
- Dynamically detect actual school IDs from production database
- Map school codes (KFNA, NFS_EAST, NFS_WEST) to their real IDs
- Generate test records using correct production school IDs

### Emergency Repair Endpoints
Created multiple repair mechanisms:
- `/api/test-scores/emergency-production-fix` - Full database repair
- `/api/test-scores/direct-sql-repair` - Direct SQL execution
- `/api/test-scores/production-deployment-fix` - Verification endpoint
