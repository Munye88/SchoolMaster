Proposal: Personal Task Documentation & Tracking Tab
Overview
We propose adding a new Personal Task Documentation & Tracking feature to the website. This feature will exist as a dedicated tab (or page) accessible only to the site administrator (the user). Its purpose is to allow the admin to log and track various personal tasks or verbal requests (for example, noting a request to approve an employee’s timesheet) in an organized manner. By having a private “task journal” within the site, the admin can ensure important tasks are documented, monitored, and not forgotten. The proposed Task Tracking tab will provide a simple form for logging tasks, along with a table view for reviewing all recorded entries at a glance. Each task entry will include key details such as the person involved, a description of the task, the date, and its current status. The status of each task will be visually color-coded (e.g. green for completed tasks) so that the admin can quickly identify which items are done and which require attention. This new tab will be designed to blend seamlessly with the existing site design that Replit is already familiar with, maintaining a consistent user interface and experience.
Functional Requirements
Task Logging Form: The feature will include an intuitive form interface where the admin can log new tasks or requests. This form should allow input of the following fields: Name (name of the individual involved or concerned), Remarks/Description (brief details or notes about the task/request), Date (the date of logging or relevant date of the task), and Status. A clear "Add" or "Save" action should be provided to submit the form and record the task entry.
Status Dropdown & Color Coding: The Status field will be a dropdown menu with three options: Completed, Pending, and Under Review. Each status selection will automatically apply a distinct color label or highlight for that entry to improve visual clarity. For example, Completed tasks could be indicated in green, Pending tasks in blue, and Under Review tasks in red. This follows common UX conventions where green signifies a good/done state and red draws attention to items that need review or action​

. The color-coding should be applied both in the form (after selection) and prominently in the task list (see below) so that the admin can identify the status of each task at a glance.
Task List Table View: All logged tasks should be displayed in a structured table (or list) within the new tab. Each row will represent a task entry and show all the key fields: Name, Description/Remarks, Date, and Status. The Status should be displayed with the corresponding color coding (e.g. the text or a badge in green/blue/red as per the status). This table allows the admin to review the history of tasks and their current states in one place. Entries should be listed in a logical order (for example, by date by default, showing the most recent tasks first). Additionally, the interface should allow for basic actions on the entries if needed, such as editing an entry or updating its status (e.g. marking a Pending task as Completed when finished) and possibly removing/correcting an entry in case of mistakes.
Sorting & Filtering (Optional): For easier management of a large number of entries over time, it would be beneficial to include basic sorting and filtering capabilities in the task list. For instance, the admin could sort the table by date (newest or oldest first), or alphabetically by name. They could also filter the list to show only tasks with a certain status (e.g. viewing only Pending tasks or only Completed tasks). Such features are common in admin panels to help find specific information quickly​

. This is a nice-to-have enhancement that will make it more efficient to review and locate tasks as the log grows. (If implementing filters is beyond the initial scope, the design should at least be structured to allow adding this in the future.)
