ResumeParser by Restpack

These APIs can:

Take a PDF or DOC resume.

Extract structured data (JSON format).

You can then map this data to your form fields.

Example Flow:
User uploads CV.

Send the file to the Resume Parser API.

Receive JSON response with extracted fields.

Auto-fill the form fields with the returned values using JavaScript.

‚úÖ 2. View and Store Candidate Details
Once parsed, you can:

Save the structured data in a database (like Firebase, Supabase, MongoDB, etc.).

Show the parsed details in a "Candidate Details" view.

‚úÖ 3. AI CV Review & Interview Questions
To take it further:

For Reviewing CVs:
Use OpenAI API (GPT-4) to analyze resumes.

Example prompt:

"Review this candidate‚Äôs resume. Summarize key qualifications, strengths, and red flags. Score them out of 10 for a Senior ELT Instructor role."

For Interview Questions:
Prompt GPT-4 to generate customized questions based on:

The role requirements

The candidate‚Äôs background

Example prompt:

"Generate 5 technical and 3 behavioral interview questions for a candidate with this resume applying for an ELT Supervisor position."

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation (In Replit)
If you're using Replit with a web front-end, here's what you'd typically do:

Frontend (React or HTML/JS):

Use a file upload component.

On upload, trigger an API call to your backend.

Backend (Node.js / Python / Flask / Express):

Receive the resume file.

Send it to the resume parser API.

Return the parsed data to the frontend.

Frontend (again):

Auto-fill the form fields with parsed data.

Save everything to your database.

Review & Interview:

Integrate OpenAI API to run CV review and generate interview questions based on parsed resume info.
