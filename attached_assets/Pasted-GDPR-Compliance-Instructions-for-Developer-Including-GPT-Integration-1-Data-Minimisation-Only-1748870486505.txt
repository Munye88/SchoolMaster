• Consent must be opt-in, not pre-ticked.
3. User Rights (Access and Deletion)

• Provide the ability to:
o Export all user data (e.g. JSON or CSV).
o Delete all user data on request, including from backups if feasible.
• Log and securely store any such actions.
4. Secure Hosting

GPT API Integration – GDPR-Specific Instructions

7. No Personal Data in GPT Prompts

• Strip all personal data from user input before sending it to GPT.
• Example: Replace “Mrs Smith at Oakwood School” with “the headteacher”.
8. Use GDPR-Compliant GPT Access

• Use OpenAI’s Teams or Enterprise API only.
• Ensure the plan includes:
o No data is used for training.
o A Data Processing Agreement (DPA) is available.
o EU/UK data residency is preferred.
9. Do Not Log GPT Prompts Containing User Content

• Do not store prompt data if it includes any user content.
• If logging is needed for debugging, anonymise all entries before storage.
10. Display AI Usage Notice in the App

• Add a simple message in the interface:
“We use AI (e.g. GPT) to support inspection readiness. No personal data is shared. All inputs are anonymised before being processed.”
